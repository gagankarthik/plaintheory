  → LLM (/llm)
  → Back to Landing
  → [Secret: Click masthead 5x]
  → Auth (/auth)
  → Dashboard (/dashboard)
```

### User Journey 2 (Authenticated):
```
Dashboard (/dashboard)
  → [Articles button]
  → Landing (/)
  → [Dashboard button visible]
  → Quick access to dashboard

## 🔐 Secret Access Methods

### Primary Method (Hidden):
1. Scroll to footer
2. Look for tiny text (8px, 20% opacity)
3. Hover to reveal: "Secret: Click the masthead 5 times"
